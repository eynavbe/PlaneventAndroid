# Planevent_Android_App
Application for organizing an event in its entirety that includes everything the hall can offer for the customer's choice. <br />
The hall owner will add his hall to the system with all the additional services he can offer, for example: DJ, arrangement of the hall, gifts for guests...
Customers who close an on-site event with the hall owner will get access to the application and will be able to choose what their event will include both in terms of the menu and in terms of the things accompanying the event that the hall offers.

## Who is the system intended for:
- For hall owners - to be able to put their hall and services in the application.
-  For the customers of the halls - who will be able to choose what they want in their event comfortably and in an orderly manner in one place and produce an event that includes everything needed in the application.
-  For small businesses - the services that the hall offers beyond the basic menu and the renting of the hall will be done through collaborations with small businesses and so they too will be able to indirectly benefit from the application.

## Permissions:
- Event hall manager
- The owner of the event / customers of the halls
